## Guidelines

- Make sure
  - Problem Statement should be there at top commented
  - Language MUST be C++ or C
  - If Possible give a commented code for better understanding
  - The problem should not exist already
  - If existing , then your code MUST be
      - increase the reabibility
      - Decrease complexity - either space or time
  - Name of file should be descriptive for example `sum_of_two_numbers.cpp` (all lower case letters)

Given Below is an example of good code

```cpp
/* Print Sum of two numbers */
/*
  Given two numbers as input 
  the output should be sum of those two numbers
*/

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int num1 = 10;
  int num1 = 20;
  int sum = num1 + num2;
  cout<<sum;
  return 0;
}
```
